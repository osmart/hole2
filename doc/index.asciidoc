_HOLE release 2.2.004 (15 Oct 2014)_

== Introduction

HOLE is a program that allows the analysis and visualisation of the pore
dimensions of the holes through molecular structures of ion channels 
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0263-7855(97)00009-x[Smart et al., 1996].
It was written by Oliver Smart while a post doc and independent 
research fellow at Birkbeck College with the assistance of several
students: 
http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/guy-coates/3/b5b/9b0[Guy Coates],
http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/joe-neduvelil/1/141/594[Joe Neduvelil],
Valeriu Niculae and Xiaonan Wang.

The first application of HOLE was to analyse the pore dimensions of gramicidin A 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349593812931[Smart et al., 1993]
working with Prof.'s 
http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/julia-goodfellow/21/14b/17a[Julia Goodfellow] and 
http://people.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/~ubcg25a/[Bonnie Wallace]. 
For many years HOLE was hosted by 
http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/sansom.php[Prof Mark Sansom] at Oxford. However,
because I was busy doing other things HOLE became unavailable about a year ago.


Although it was written over 20 years ago, HOLE remains in demand and its 
main publications have been cited over 800 times. 
The founding of SmartSci Limited has provided the opportunity to
make HOLE available again and to provide some updates and improvements.

== How to setup HOLE

The HOLE suite is now distributed from http://www.smartsci.uk/hole/

Download the compressed tar ball relevant for your system e.g., +hole2.2_003_linux64.tar.gz+ and place it in your home directory.
Unpacking this tar ball will create the directory hole2 containing files for your distribution. Use the commands:

 cd
 tar xf hole2.2.003.linux64.tar.gz

These commands will create the directories:

* +hole2/doc/index.html+ is the main documentation (this file).
* +hole2/exe+ contains the main executables
* +hole2/rad+ contains a the radius set files needed by hole
* +hole2/examples+ contains a series of example input files for example runs with hole.

To run the HOLE program and the other executables you can just type the full name of the program. To test that the executable works on your computer by typing at the unix prompt:

 ~/hole2/exe/hole
 *** Program HOLE ***
  
_(edited for brevity)_

  Control variables read:

The hole program should start and wait for input - hit ctrl-d (the control and d keys together) to get out of this or ctrl-c to interupt. If the program fails to load then please email support@smartsci.uk 

It is normally most convenient to add the hole executable directory to the the unix path (this would allow hole to be started by typing "hole"). Suppose user "mary" has set up the package.

If you are a tcsh or csh user add the following line at the end of your +~/.cshrc+ file

        setenv PATH "$PATH":~mary/hole2/exe

or otherwise if you are a bash user add the line that follows to the file that is used to set your ENV. This file is normally called following +\~/.bashrc+ or +\~/.profile+ or +\~/.kshrc+

        PATH=$PATH:~mary/hole2/exe

[{mytipicon}]
TIP: if unsure which shell you are running enter the command +echo $SHELL+

Open a new shell (if unsure about this logout and then log back into your terminal). You should be able to run the HOLE executables by typing the command name - try it out by typing +hole+ if there is an error then make sure that you have permission to use the executables by typing +ls -l \~mary/hole2/exe+. If you cannot see list the directory then go and speak to Mary who should change the permissions for the top hole2 directory (+chmod a+rx ~/hole2+).

Unless you have installed hole in your own space you will need to modify the
examples provided to point to the correct radius files. When specifying a file
for vdw radii (using a RADIUS card) you can use files in mary's area e.g.,
specify the following line in the

 control file: radius ~mary/hole2/rad/simple.rad

[{mynoteicon}]
NOTE: HOLE now resolves ~'s for user names. 

== Example Application

The best way to show how to run HOLE is to use an actual example.
For an example we will use an NMR structural of the gramcidin A channel, determined
by Arseniev and co-workers http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1grm[1GRM].
This supplied as an example with HOLE. So the first thing is to copy the files
into a convenient convenient directory and then +cd+ into it:
  
  cp -a ~/hole2/examples/01_gramicidin_1grm hole_test
  cd hole_test

The +ls+ command should then show that the directory contains the files 

  1grm_single.pdb hole.inp

=== Running HOLE

HOLE is a rather old-style program that by defaults reads from standard input
(the keyboard) and writes in text type output to standard output (your terminal window).
So to usefully run HOLE you must redirect both input and output to a file. For
example:

+*hole < hole.inp > hole_out.txt*+

Here the program input is provided by file +01_example.inp+ and all input goes
to file +hole_out.txt+. The command should complete almost instantly.

[{mytipicon}]
TIP: If this is all new to you then Google _Command line redirection linux tutorial_. There 
excellent tutorials available, for instance http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/piping.php


Lets look at the input file  +hole.inp+

	! example input file run on Arseniev's gramicidin structure
	! note everything preceded by a "!" is a comment and will be ignored by HOLE
	!
	! follow instructions in doc/index.html to run this job
	!
	! first cards which must be  included for HOLE to work
	! note that HOLE input is case insensitive (except file names)
	coord 1grm_single.pdb           ! Co-ordinates in pdb format
	radius ~/hole2/rad/simple.rad	! Use simple AMBER vdw radii
					! n.b. can use ~ in hole
	!
	! now optional cards
	sphpdb hole_out.sph             ! pdb format output of hole sphere centre info
					! (for use in sph_process program)
	endrad 5.			! This is the pore radius that is taken
					! as where channel ends. 5.0 Angstroms is good 
					! for a narrow channel

* The +coord+ card must be used to specify the input pdb FILE
* The +radius+ card must also be specified (it is normal to use +simple.rad+)
* The +sphpdb+ card is used to output the sphere centres produced by HOLE to a "pseudo-PDB" file.  
  Each of the "ATOM"s in the file has the pore radius in the B-factor and occupancy columns. 
  The +sphpdb+ file is normally used to produce a dot surface or solid-rendered surface (see below). 
  
[{mytipicon}]
[TIP]
================
It is possible to directly display the +sphpdb+ file in a molecular graphics program.
Load the +.sph+ file as a PDB file. For instance, in 
http://www.pymol.org/[PyMOL] a crude representation of the HOLE surface
can be obtained turning showing the files as spheres and using the command 

   alter hole_out.sph,  vdw=b

to set the vdw radius to be equal to +b+ (the pore radius). This results in a "dumbbell" -
it would be much better to convert HOLE objects to 
http://pymol.sourceforge.net/newman/user/S0500cgo.html[PyMOL CGO]s but this needs a bit of coding!
================

[{mynoteicon}]
NOTE: For complicated channels with multiple routes through them it is possible to combine
a number of HOLE +.sph+ files together.

=== Visualization of the results

The following diagram summarizes the main methods of visualizing hole results
with release 2.2 of hole using the vmd program. There is clear room for
improvement and simplification - this will be addressed in future releases.

=== Plotting a 2D graph of pore radius vs channel coordinate

One of the more useful ways to visualize the results of HOLE is to plot a graph 
(all those school teachers/university demonstrators must have some influence). 
Raw data which can be used for this purpose is written at the end of the run output
file. For the gramicidin example text output +link:hole_test/hole_out.txt[hole_out.txt]+ is produced.
The graph information can be found near the end of the file starting after the line:

  cenxyz.cvec      radius  cen_line_D sum{s/(area point sourc

You can use an editor to extract the information or use +egrep+:

+*egrep "mid-|sampled" hole_out.txt  > hole_out.tsv*+

The +.tsv+ file can be opened in most spreadsheets and graphing for instance in
excel.  On linux I like xmgrace (but it is a complex) or gnumeric (easier).

+*gnumeric hole_out.tsv*+

For the abscissa of the graph it is normal to use the 'channel coordinate' -
this is dot product of the sphere centre with the channel vector CVECT. If the
channel is aligned along an axis, for instance the y axis (channel vector = {0 1
0}, the channel coordinate will simply be the relevant coordinate. An
alternative is to use the distance moved along the pore centre-line from the
initial point. The former representation, which was suggested by Mark Sansom,
is probably preferable as it allows easy comparison between the results of
different runs and for the position of important atoms/residues to be marked on
the graph. The latter representation gives an indication of the straightness of
the pore but comparison between runs is made more difficult by side to side
jumps in the centre line. 

It is simple to add some axis labels in gnumeric.

*HOLE results on 1grm (spherical probe)*

It can be seen that the pore radius within the gramicidin A channel varies between
1.15 and 1.5 Angstroms. Gramicidin A is normally occupied by a single file of around 
8 water molecules.  For a more detailed coverage see 
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349593812931[Smart et al., 1993]


=== Producing a colored dot surface and visualizing in vmd
Being able to visualize HOLE results together with the ion channel model in a molecular
graphics program is really useful. HOLE was originally written to work with the Quanta
program (in fact a predecessor of Quanta called Hydra). It has conversion tools for a variety
of other programs. HOLE really works well with vmd http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ and
we will look at how to display HOLE graphical objects in vmd. 

The starting point for visualizing HOLE results is to produce a surface from the raw
HOLE sphere files stored in the +.sph+ file produced by +sphpdb+ option of HOLE. In this example
the file is called +hole_out.sph+.

The simplest surface to look at is a dot surface. To produce a dot surface from  +hole_out.sph+
use the +sph_process+ program (supplied with HOLE):

+*sph_process -dotden 15 -color hole_out.sph dotsurface.qpt*+

* The +-dotden+ option is used to increase the number of dots on the surface. 
* The +-color+ option is used to produce a colored surface. Red is where the pore radius 
  is to tight for a water molecule. Green where there is room for a single water. Blue is where
  the radius is double the minimum for a single.
* To see more detail and other options run +*sph_process -h*+
* The +dotsurface.qpt+ file code be displayed in Quanta but you probably want to use vmd. 
  So it is necessary to use qpt_conv (at present). This is an interactive program 
  (it seemed like a good idea many years ago). You have to select option +D+ and hit
  the _Enter_ key three times to do the conversion:


+*qpt_conv*+ +
+_initial splash message not shown here_+
 
 This program converts a .qpt file (as produced by hole) 
  to something else.
 Output options
 'A' to/from ascii version of original .qpt (can then edit)
 'C' A .qpt file in which dots are replaced by 3D crosses
 'L' A .qpt file with long lines split into smaller sections
       (useful for proper depth queueing in qplot)
 'I' InsightII format
 'R' Rasmol format
 'S' Sybyl format
 'K' to David C. Richardson's kinemage format
 'O' for use with O program
 'V' to Virtual Reality Markup Language
 'D' to VMD format

+Enter conversion option character <stop program>: *D*+

 S/r qptvmd. 
   Reads in a hydra/quanta 3D binary plot and writes
   out an VMD equivalent.  To use this file in VMD type:
 source blah.vmd_plot
   at the vmd prompt
 Please enter input binary hydra/quanta plot (old) filename
 defaults <dotsurface.qpt> ext:<.qpt> (abort by EXIT or ^D) : 
 Please enter vmd format file (new) filename
 defaults <dotsurface.vmd_plot> ext:<.vmd_plot> (abort by EXIT or ^D) : 
 What width do you want lines to appear <1>: 

* The end result of this is a file +dotsurface.vmd_plot+ To use this in vmd
** Start vmd and load +1grm_single.pdb+
** select a pretty graphical representation (here _liquorice_ with _tube_ colored by chain).
** Then go to the terminal window where you started vmd. Hit the _Enter_ key. You will then
   see the vmd command prompt:

 vmd >

** At the prompt enter the command:w
: +
+*source dotsurface.vmd_plot*+
** you will then see the dot surface in the VMD window. A great way to make pictures of this
   is with vmd supplied Tachyon to produce a ray traced result

=== Producing a triangulated surface and visualizing in vmd

The dot surface is nice (it made me happy in 1993) and
is still the most useful way to actually visualize results.
However, if you want a pretty picture for poster/paper a solid
surface is better.

Producing a triangulated surface is similar to the dot surface. 
We use +hole_out.sph+ as the starting point and run

+*sph_process -sos -dotden 15 -color hole_out.sph solid_surface.sos*+

The +.sos+ is an intermediate file that needs to be processed by +sos_triangle+

+*sos_triangle -s <  solid_surface.sos > solid_surface.vmd_plot*+

To load in vmd +source solid_surface.vmd_plot+ at the +vmd >+ prompt (see above). 
The result is a nice solid surface:
